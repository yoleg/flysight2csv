# Directory Structure

- `device1/` and `device2/` - a set of CSV files gathered with two different devices during overlapping times
  - Only a few of the files are complete. Most have been truncated to speed up tests.
- `invalid/` - altered files that should not be accepted by the validator
- `formatted/` - used by tests for output format checking
