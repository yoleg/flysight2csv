# Installation

First, make sure you have Python 3.10 or later installed. You can check this by running:

`python --version`

If needed, you can download the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The package is published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/flysight2csv/) and can be installed with `pip` (or any equivalent):

```shell
pip install flysight2csv
```

ðŸ’¡ TIP: Consider using [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/) or a
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to avoid installing packages globally.

Once that completes, reopen your terminal and run `flysight2csv --help` to confirm it is installed correctly.

ðŸ’¡ Additional help with `pip` is available at the [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

See also the {ref}`troubleshooting section <troubleshooting>`.

Next, see the {ref}`section about usage <usage>` to see how to use it.
